# Dar-es-Salaam-Air-Quality-Forecast
Forecasting PM2.5 levels in Dar es Salaam using historical data.

### Air Quality Prediction Project Summary
This project aims to predict PM2.5 levels in Dar es Salaam using historical air quality data. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which can pose significant health risks.

### Key Steps
Data Preparation:

Connected to a MongoDB server to access air quality data.
Extracted and prepared the data for analysis.
### Data Visualization:

Used rolling averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends.
Created Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots to understand the relationship between current and past values.
Model Training:

### Employed an AutoRegressive (AR) model to predict PM2.5 levels.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning to find the best lag values.
Used walk-forward validation to ensure the model adapts to new data and mimics real-world scenarios.

### Conclusion
The project stresses the importance of applying Data Science in Air Quality Studies in Meeting Environmental Sustainability and Control and Managing risk to Health

### Recommendation
Use of Sophisticated Models and Updating of Dataset. Analyzing of Contributing factors and Statistical Analysis
